## Extraction of metadata from DOI addresses via CrossRef API.

This program grabs a DOI from an array and extracts metadata (title, author, etc) by consuming the CrossRef public API. 
After consuming the API, it sends the extracted metadata to a PostgreSQL database stored remotely on a Supabase bucket.

WIP.
